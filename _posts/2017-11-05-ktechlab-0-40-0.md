KTechLab, the IDE for microcontrollers and electronics,
has reached a new milestone:
its latest release, 0.40.0, does not depend on KDE3 and Qt3, but on KDE4 and Qt4.
This meeans that KTechLab can be compiled and ran on current
operating systems.

In the new, KDE4 and Qt4 based release, practically all features of the
previous version are kept.
Circuits, including PIC microcontrollers can be simulated,
the programs running on PICs can be edited in C, ASM format, or
graphically, by using Flowcode,
and these programs can be easily prepared for programming real PICs.
The only feature which has been removed is
DCOP integration, which is not available in KDE4, and
should be replaced with D-Bus integration.

Below I'm presenting screenshots of KTechLab's
latest release.

FlowCode is a graphical editor for programs.
Practically a flowchart can be compiled to a program
running on a PIC microcontroller.

Circuits are simulated electronic circuits.
Some components are interactive, like switches,
so the user of KTechLab can change their state in real-time.

C and ASM files are source code which can be compiled
and uploaded to a simulated PIC micrcocontroller or
to a real PIC microcontroller.

For details about running and debugging programs for
PICs, I recommend reading my previous post on the topic:
