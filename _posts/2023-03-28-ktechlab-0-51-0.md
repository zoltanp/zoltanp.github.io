I'm happy to announce KTechLab release version 0.51.0.
KTechLab is an IDE for microcontrollers and electronics.
This new release contains the following changes:
- updated and improved translations
- the Serial Port component, for better compatibility, uses Qt's QSerialPort, instead of operating-system specific library calls
- experimental support for Windows; it requires MSVC 2019 compiler
- various stability fixes
- modernisation of the codebase, porting away from some deprecated APIs



[The release tarball of version 0.51.0 can be downloaded from KDE servers](https://download.kde.org/unstable/ktechlab/ktechlab-0.51.0.tar.xz.mirrorlist).
Its checksums are:
