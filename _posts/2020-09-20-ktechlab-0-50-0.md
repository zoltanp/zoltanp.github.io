I'm happy to announce KTechLab release version 0.50.0.
KTechLab is an IDE for microcontrollers and electronics.
In this new release every user-visible functionality is
the same as in previous releases,
however, the codebase of KTechLab has been updated,
so now it is a KF5/Qt5 application
and it does not depend anymore on KDELibs4Support libraries.

This release should compile and run on systems where KDELibs4Support
libraries are not available.

In its current state KTechLab's codebase is ready for fixes and enhancements,
as it only depends on modern libraries like KDE Frameworks 5 (KF5) and Qt5.
As a side note, KF6 and Qt6 have been announced,
and the first release of Qt6 has been scheduled [to the end of 2020](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_6.0_Release).


[The release tarball of version 0.50.0 can be downloaded from KDE servers](https://download.kde.org/unstable/ktechlab/ktechlab-0.50.0.tar.xz.mirrorlist).
