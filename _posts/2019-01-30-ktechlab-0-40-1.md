I'm happy to announce KTechLab release version 0.40.1.
KTechLab is an IDE for microcontrollers and electronics.
In this new release every user-visible functionality is
the same as in previous releases,
however, the codebase of KTechLab has been updated,
so now it is a pure KDELibs4 and Qt4 application
and it does not depend anymore on kde3support and qt3support libraries.

This release should compile and run on systems where kde3support or qt3support
libraries are not available.

In its current state KTechLab's codebase is ready to be ported
to KDE Frameworks 5 (KF5) and Qt5.
So a future release of KTechLab could only depend on modern libraries
like KF5 and Qt5.


[The release tarball of version 0.40.1 can be downloaded from KDE servers](https://download.kde.org/unstable/ktechlab/ktechlab-0.40.1.tar.xz.mirrorlist).
Its checksums are:
